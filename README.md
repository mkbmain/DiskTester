DiskTester

This was created when I acquired a lot of cheap usb drives from a popular site.

I could not belive how cheap they where and assumed they where drives of a lot smaller capicity that had been flashed to read as high capacity so I wrote this tool to test um.



It allows you to pick a drive and then it will determine its size write a file that fills the empty space then read back that file and ensure its all there 


please note make sure the usb is ntfs or exfat if bigger than a few GB as fat32 does not support single files bigger than a few GBs
